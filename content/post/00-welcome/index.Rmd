Welcome, everyone! I hope you find this R bootcamp useful for your learning. There's a LOT going on in the world right now, and if learning R (let alone learning *anything* new) feels next to impossible at the moment -- I totally get it. But just know that there is an abundance of resources at your disposal for learning and a community that will support you through it.
