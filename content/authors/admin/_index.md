# UO Psych R Bootcamp 2020

Welcome to the 3rd annual R Bootcamp hosted by the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon. 

This website contains all of the details and materials for the bootcamp, along with resources for further learning and practice. The materials have been designed such that you should be able to work through the slides and exercises at your own pace if you're not able to attend the bootcamp sessions. Happy learning!
