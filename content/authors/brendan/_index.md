Brendan is a PhD student and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow in the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon. His work in the [Social and Affective Neuroscience Lab](https://sanlab.uoregon.edu/) focuses on individual differences in health behavior and predictive modelling of real-world health outcomes in an effort to advance a precision medicine framework for behavioral health. 

He has [taught](https://bcullen.rbind.io/courses/) statistics and data science at both the undergraduate and graduate levels and loves helping new learners get up and running with the tidyverse. He particularly enjoys leveraging the power of R Markdown and Shiny to create different learning formats that are as accessible and engaging as possible and values kindness and inclusivity above all else in his teaching.
