Hello! Welcome to the 3rd annual UO Psych R Bootcamp. As we are forced to run the bootcamp online this year due to COVID-19, there are a few things we'd like you to do before we get started to make things run as smoothly as possible. If possible, please try to complete this checklist *before* the first session.

1) Make sure you have a Zoom account set up through University of Oregon. 

2) Join the [slack channel](https://uodatascience.slack.com/). This is the best place to ask questions outside of bootcamp hours. We'll be using the channel `#bootcamp2020`.

2) Create an [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account (choose the [Cloud Free](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free) option).

Looking forward to seeing you all soon. We'll have you loving R in no time!

-Brendan
