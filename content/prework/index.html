<p>Hello! Welcome to the 3rd annual UO Psych R Bootcamp. As we are forced to run the bootcamp online this year due to COVID-19, there are a few things we’d like you to do before we get started to make things run as smoothly as possible. If possible, please try to complete this checklist <em>before</em> the first session.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Make sure you have a <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom account</a> set up through University of Oregon.</p></li>
<li><p>Join the <a href="https://uodatascience.slack.com/">slack channel</a>. This is the best place to ask questions outside of bootcamp hours. We’ll be using the channel <code>#bootcamp2020</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create an <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/">RStudio Cloud</a> account (choose the <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free">Cloud Free</a> option).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you all soon. We’ll have you loving R in no time!</p>
<p>-Brendan</p>
