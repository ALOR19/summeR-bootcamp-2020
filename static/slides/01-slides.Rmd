# Basic computing

```{r}
# Addition
2 + 3

# Subtraction
2 - 3

# Multiplication
2 * 3

# Division
10/2
```


---
# Basic computing

```{r}
# Exponents
4^2

# Roots
4^(1/2)
```

--

+ Thankfully, R follows the order of operations (PEMDAS).

```{r}
2^3 + 4 * 1/2
```

--

+ These values arenâ€™t stored anywhere though...

---
# Storing values in objects

+ To keep a value in memory, we need to assign it to an **object**. 

--

+ To assign a value to an object, use the **assignment operator**. It looks like a left-pointing arrow: 

.center[
```{r eval=FALSE}
<-
```
]

--

+ Let's use `<-` to create an object called x, that is assigned the number 8. 

```{r}
x <- 8 
```

--

+ Now we can call `x` by name; if we do this, it will print the value.

```{r}
x
```

---
# Style

+ Technically, both `<-` and `=` both work as assignment operators. But we'll strictly use `<-` from here on out. This brings up a general coding principle of the day...

--

+ *Style is important!* You want to use a consistent style so that others (including your future self) can easily and quickly read your code. 

  + I highly recommend following the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). 

--

+ Hint: You will type `<-` a LOT. The keyboard shortcut `Alt`+`-` or `Option`+`-` can be used to insert a `<-`.

---
# Storing values in objects

+ Now, let's take a look at the variable `y`

--

```{r error=TRUE}
# call y
y 
```

+ Whoops! We didn't assign anything to `y`. Calling a variable that doesn't exist leads to an **error message**. 

+ You'll see a LOT of error messages when using R. This is *100% normal*. Don't worry when this happens. 

--

```{r}
# Need to assign something to y!
y <- 2

y
```

---
# Storing values in objects

Now, we can use these variables in calculations
```{r}
# multiply them
x * y
```

--

But remember, if we want to save the output of that calculation, we need to assign them to an object! 

```{r}
# define the product as z
z <- x * y

# view z
z
```

---
# Naming variables 

You may be wondering how to name variables in R. Well, there are just a few rules:

1. object names must start with a letter

2. can contain alphanumeric characters, "_", and "."

3. R is case sensitive, so `A` and `a` would be different variables

---
# Naming variables 

This is another element of *style*. Using a consistent style when naming variables makes your life easier. 

.pull-left[

+ this_is_snake_case
+ thisIsCamelCase
+ avoid.using.periods

I'll be using snake_case from here on, but you can change to another option if you'd like.

# Your turn `r (yt_counter <- yt_counter + 1)` `r icon::fa("cloud")`

Create a variable called `var_1` that is equal to 4. Then create a variable called `var_2` that is `var_1` raised to the power of 6. Print the results.

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 1, seconds = 30)
```

# Solution

```{r}
var_1 <- 4
var_2 <- var_1^6
```

```{r}
var_1
var_2
```
