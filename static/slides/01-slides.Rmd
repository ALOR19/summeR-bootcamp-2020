# Basics of R & RStudio

---
# Learning objectives 

---
# Getting comfortable with RStudio

Let's start by looking at how RStudio is organized

# Basic computing

```{r}
# Addition
2 + 3

# Subtraction
2 - 3

# Multiplication
2 * 3

# Division
10/2
```


---
# Basic computing

```{r}
# Exponents
4^2

# Roots
4^(1/2)
```

--

+ Thankfully, R follows the order of operations (PEMDAS).

```{r}
2^3 + 4 * 1/2
```

--

+ These values arenâ€™t stored anywhere though...

---
# Storing values in objects

+ To keep a value in memory, we need to assign it to an **object**. 

--

+ To assign a value to an object, use the **assignment operator**. It looks like a left-pointing arrow: 

.center[
#`<-`
]

--

+ Let's use `<-` to create an object called x, that is assigned the number 8. 

```{r}
x <- 8 
```

--

+ Now we can call `x` by name; if we do this, it will print the value.

```{r}
x
```

---
# Style

+ Technically, both `<-` and `=` both work as assignment operators. But we'll strictly use `<-` from here on out. This brings up a general coding principle of the day...

--

+ *Style is important!* You want to use a consistent style so that others (including your future self) can easily and quickly read your code. 

  + I highly recommend following the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). 

--

+ Hint: You will type `<-` a LOT. The keyboard shortcut `Alt+-` or `Option+-` can be used to insert a `<-`.

---
# Storing values in objects

+ Now, let's take a look at the variable `y`

--

```{r error=TRUE}
# call y
y 
```

+ Whoops! We didn't assign anything to `y`. Calling a variable that doesn't exist leads to an **error message**. 

+ You'll see a LOT of error messages when using R. This is *100% normal*. Don't worry when this happens. 

--

```{r}
# Need to assign something to y!
y <- 2

y
```
